 - "[O]pposition to subordination and dominance in all of its endless forms: subordination of women to men, of children to adults, of creatures and the earth to human beings... [opposition to] imperialism, colonialism, racism, homophobia, dominance heirarchies [sic] of every kind, and every mechanism and device by way of which human beings are dominated and subordinated... [T]he building of, the creation of, a new world which rejects dominance and subordination in all of its forms in favor of mutuality, and therefore, the potential for real and true love, including erotic love, between human beings, and with it, the flourishing of human creativity which is the offspring of real love. In the end, radical feminism is about the possibility for real happiness and real pleasure for all human beings."
